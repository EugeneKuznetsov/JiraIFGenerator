# Jira WADL interface generator 
Jira REST API endpoints interface generator for Jira QML extension module

### Purpose
Jira REST API plugin for QML defines endpoints as a key interface for making
any request to Jira. Each endpoint represents a Jira resource which could be
accessed via public calls defined by such endpoint. It would take a lot of 
time to implement interface of each endpoint. Interface generator increases 
the speed of endpoints development.
